# CTAT-detector-plugins

**Current examples:**
- **error categorizer:** keeps a count of student errors, categorized under a particular canonicalization scheme
	- Current canonicalization schemes include:
		- Simple canonicalization
			- 
		- Change-based canonicalization
			- 
			- [insert image of diff visual]
	- In-development canonicalization schemes include:
		- Labeled error categories (verbal category descriptions, which DO NOT infer underlying misconceptions)
			- Example categories include: ... , ... , ...
		- Inferred misconceptions (verbal category descriptions, which DO infer underlying misconceptions)
			- Example categories include: ... , ... , ...
	- Don't like any of the above canonicalization schemes? Please contribute to this collection by creating your own canonicalization function, and feel free to use one of our examples as a guiding template.

	- In-development help-seeking models include

- **current-step error count**

- **stagnation**



**In-development:**
- **BKT**
	- at least one variant of BKT and at least one BKT-driven detector
		- predictive stability
		- possibly: BKT + contextual guess and slip --> Arroyo et al., carelessness detector
- **a cognitive gaming detector**
  
- at least one detector of a student's affective state (boredom detector tends to have higher accuracy than other affect detectors)
